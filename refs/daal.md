# Daal

## Ingredients:

1. one cup of daal.
2. five cloves of garlic. üßÑ
3. one large onion. üßÖ
4. three red dried chilies. üå∂
5. 3 tablespoons of oil.
6. salt as required.
7. handful of coriander leaves. (Optional)
8. a teaspoon of turmeric.
9. 2 tomatoes. (Optional) üçÖ

## Instructions:

1. wash dal really well and boil it with three cups of water. Use the same cup to measure the dal and the water.
2. while on the stove, add the turmeric and salt to the dal. Stir it all together. Here, you can also add the tomatoes if you want to.
3. while that is boiling, on a separate frying pan, add the oil, onion, garlic, and chillies. Fry it all together. When the onions are transparent, turn off the stove and throw it in with the dal. STIR IT ALL TOGETHER REALLY WELL SO THE DAL GETS THE FLAVOR OF THE ONION, GARLIC, RED CHILLIES, ALL OVER. It could take from three to five minutes depending on how high the heat is.
4. when the dal starts bubbling up, lower the temperature and let it simmer for at least seven minutes. Make sure the dal doesn‚Äôt overflow so make sure the temperature is as low as it gets. Continue to stir everything really well together. Add salt as required.
5. let it simmer for five more minutes and add more water if needed. The dal should not dry up in the process of boiling. It should be watery yet super flavorful.
6. throw in the coriander and let that simmer for two two minutes. You may skip this step too if you want.
